CowTech style TSLint config

https://github.com/cowtech/tslint-config

Starting from version **5.10.0**, it is now based on [standard](https://standardjs.com/) which will differ on only few specific cases.

## Usage

In your tslint.json configuration file, insert the following statement:

```typescript
// ...
"extends": ["@cowtech/tslint-config"]
// ...
```

## Contributing to @cowtech/tslint-config

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
